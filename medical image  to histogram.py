路  [0]: The index of the channel to analyze. In this case, 0 refers to the first channel (typically the grayscale channel for single-channel images).
路  None: No mask is applied to the image.
路  [256]: The number of bins for the histogram (256 for pixel values ranging from 0 to 255).
路  [0, 256]: The range of pixel values.   '''
